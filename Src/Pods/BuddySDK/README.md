# Buddy SDK

These release notes are for the 2.0 Preview release of the Buddy Platform SDK.
Not everything in the SDK is currently fully implemented, and not all REST endpoints have yet been exposed in the SDK.

Please refer to [dev.buddyplatform.com/home/docs](http://dev.buddyplatform.com/home/docs) for more details on the SDK 
You can also visit [preview.buddy.com](http://preview.buddy.com) for more details on the Buddy Platform Version 2 Preview Release.

## Introduction

Buddy enables developers to build engaging, cloud-connected apps without having to write, test, manage or scale server-side code or infrastructure. We noticed that most mobile app developers end up writing the same code over and over again.  User management, photo management, geolocation checkins, metadata, and more.  

Buddy's easy-to-use, scenario-focused APIs let you spend more time building your app, and less time worrying about backend infrastructure.  

Let us handle that stuff for you!

## Features

For developers the Buddy Platform offers turnkey support for features like the following:

* *User Accounts* - create, delete, authenticate users.
* *Photos* - add photos, search photos, share photos with other users.
* *Geolocation* - checkin, search for places, list past checkins.
* *Push Notifications* - easily send push notifications to iOS, Android, or Microsoft devices.
* *Messaging* - send messages to other users, create message groups.
* *User Lists* - set up relationships between users.
* *Game Scores, Metadata, and Boards* - Keep track of game stores and states for individual users as well as across users.
